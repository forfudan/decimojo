# Big Binary Integer plan

> Date of initial planning: 2026-02-20

> Scope: A new integer type with 2^32-based internal representation

The current `BigInt10` is based on `BigUInt` which uses a decimal representation with a base of 10^9. This design choice is to re-use the same data structure for the buffers of `BigInt10` (as we implemented `BigUInt` initially for `BigDecimal`). However, when users use `BigInt10` for general integer arithmetic, a binary representation with a base of 2^32 (or 2^64) would be more efficient. Thus, it is nice to have a separate binary implementation of `BigInt2` as the core integer type, while keeping the current decimal implementation of `BigInt10` for some special use cases (e.g., as a intermediate type when printing `BigInt2`). The `BigUInt` will continue to serve as the base type for `BigDecimal`.

## Type system and renaming plan

Currently we have:

| type         | alias             | information                          | base |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| `BigDecimal` | `BDec`, `Decimal` | arbitrary-precision decimal          | 10^9 |
| `BigInt`     | `BInt`            | arbitrary-precision integer          | 10^9 |
| `BigUInt`    | `BUInt`           | arbitrary-precision unsigned integer | 10^9 |
| `Decimal128` | `Dec128`          | 128-bit fixed-precision decimal      | -    |

In the future, we will have:

| type         | alias             | information                                               | internal representation |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `BigDecimal` | `BDec`, `Decimal` | Decimal，arbitrary precision                              | 10^9                    |
| `BigInt2`    | `BInt`            | Binary，as core big int type                              | 2^32                    |
| `BigInt10`   | `BInt10`          | Decimal，gradually hidden from users                      | 10^9                    |
| `BigUInt`    | `BUInt`           | Decimal，as base type for `BigDecimal`, hidden from users | 10^9                    |
| `Decimal128` | `Dec128`          | Decimal，128-bit fixed precision                          | -                       |

Current `BigInt10` and `BigUInt` are implemented based on 10^9 decimal representation. `BigUInt` will continue to serve as the base type for `BigDecimal`.

At the same time, we will develop a new binary implementation of `BigInt2` as the core integer type.

Once `BigInt2` is stable and performs well, we will proceed with renaming:

- `BigInt` will be renamed to `BigInt10`
- The alias `BInt` will be assigned to `BigInt2` (binary implementation)

Then `BigInt10` and `BigUInt` will be hidden from users, leaving only `BigInt2` (binary implementation) and `BigDecimal` (decimal implementation) exposed to users.
