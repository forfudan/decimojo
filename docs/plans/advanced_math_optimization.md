## Background

Benchmarks against `mpmath` (Python, backed by GMP/MPIR) show DeciMojo's trig and pi functions are significantly slower — ranging from ~200× slower (sin at low precision) to ~500,000× slower (pi at 10,000 digits). This is expected given DeciMojo's pure-Mojo base-10^9 arithmetic vs. GMP's highly optimized base-2^64 assembly core. The accuracy is excellent (full precision digits match WolframAlpha); this document is purely about performance.

## Identified Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Pi Caching (High Impact, Low Effort)

**Current behavior:** Every call to `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()` recomputes π from scratch via Chudnovsky binary splitting. `tan()` is worst — it calls `sin()` and `cos()` independently, each of which computes π, so a single `tan()` call computes π 3–4 times.

**What can be done:** Once Mojo supports module-level mutable globals, enable the cache so that `pi(precision)` returns the precomputed value instead of recomputing when precision is low. For higher precision, a runtime cache can store the highest-precision π computed so far and reuse it for subsequent calls at equal or lower precision.

### 2. Excessive Buffer Digits in Trigonometric Functions (High Impact, Low Effort)

**Current behavior:** `sin()`, `cos()`, and `tan_cot()` all use `BUFFER_DIGITS = 99`. This means a request for 50-digit precision actually computes at 149 digits — nearly 3× the requested work. The buffer exists to ensure accurate range reduction near π-related values - I want to be conservative at this stage.

**What can be done:** Profile to determine how many buffer digits are actually needed for correctness. A value of 15–30 is likely sufficient for most cases. An adaptive approach is also possible: use a smaller buffer normally and only increase it when the input is detected to be close to a multiple of π/2.

### 3. cos() Implementation (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

**Current behavior:** `cos(x, precision)` computes `sin(π/2 - x, precision)`. This means every `cos()` call: (a) computes π from scratch, (b) delegates to `sin()` which computes π again for its own range reduction. So `cos()` computes π at least twice. Meanwhile, `cos_taylor_series()` already exists and works correctly — `sin()` itself uses it internally for inputs in the (π/4, π/2) range.

**What can be done:** Implement `cos()` with its own range reduction (analogous to `sin()`'s range reduction) that directly calls `cos_taylor_series()` for the base case. This avoids the double π computation entirely.

### 4. Chudnovsky Binary Splitting: Factorial/Power Recomputation (High Impact, Medium Effort)

**Current behavior:** Each leaf node in `chudnovsky_split()` calls `compute_m_k_rational(k)`, which computes `(6k)! / (3k)!` and `(k!)^3` from scratch using loops. Similarly, `X(k) = (-262537412640768000)^k` is computed by multiplying in a loop `k` times. This means factorial products are rebuilt from 1 for every single term.

**What can be done:** The standard approach for Chudnovsky binary splitting uses a 3-variable recursion `(P, Q, B)` where each recursive level combines its children's partial products — no per-leaf factorial computation is needed. The recurrence relations are:

- `P(a,b) = P(a,m) * Q(m,b) + P(m,b) * Q(a,m)`
- `Q(a,b) = Q(a,m) * Q(m,b)`
- `B(a,b) = B(a,m) * B(m,b)`

This is the standard formulation used by y-cruncher, GMP's `mpfr_const_pi`, and mpmath.

### 5. tan() Redundant Range Reduction (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

**Current behavior:** `tan_cot()` performs its own modular reduction to `(-π/2, π/2)`, then calls `sin()` and `cos()` independently. Each of `sin()` and `cos()` performs their own range reduction again (computing π again).

**What can be done:** After `tan_cot()` reduces `x` to `(-π/2, π/2)`, pass the reduced value directly to Taylor series evaluation rather than going through the full `sin()`/`cos()` entry points. This skips redundant range reduction and π computation. Alternatively, compute `tan()` via its own Taylor series or continued fraction expansion.

### 6. Argument Reduction via Multiplication Instead of Division (Low Impact, Low Effort)

**Current behavior:** Range reduction computes `π/2` and `π/4` via `pi.true_divide(2, ...)` and `pi.true_divide(4, ...)`.

**What can be done:** Multiplication by `0.5` or `0.25` (or a right-shift by 1–2 in the coefficient) is cheaper than arbitrary-precision division. This is a minor optimization but essentially free to implement.

### 7. Toom-3 and NTT/FFT Multiplication (High Impact, High Effort)

**Current behavior:** Multiplication uses Karatsuba with a crossover at 64 words (~576 digits). Karatsuba is O(n^1.585), which is competitive up to ~1000 digits but falls behind for larger operands.

**What can be done.** Two natural next steps for large multiplication are:

- **Toom-3:** O(n^1.465), a natural next step above Karatsuba. Adds one more level of divide-and-conquer.
- **NTT/FFT:** O(n log n), transformative for large multiplications (thousands of digits). This would benefit pi, exp, ln, and all functions that chain many large multiplications.

**Note:** NTT/FFT is a long-term consideration with no concrete timeline.

### 8. Base Representation

**Current:** DeciMojo uses base 10^9 with UInt32 words. GMP uses base 2^64 with native 64-bit words, which is inherently more efficient for binary hardware (full use of 64-bit multiply/divide, double the digits per word).

**Decision:** Changing to base 2^64 would fundamentally alter the library architecture (input/output conversion, all arithmetic routines, decimal scaling logic). **This is not planned** — DeciMojo is a decimal arithmetic library and the base-10^9 representation aligns with its purpose.

### 9. GMP Backend Option (Long-Term Consideration)

For users who need high-performance transcendental functions and are willing to accept a native dependency, a future option is to provide a GMP-backed implementation of sin, cos, pi, etc. at the lower level (similar to how mpmath delegates to GMP). DeciMojo would also continue to provide pure-Mojo fallbacks for environments where GMP is not available or where a dependency-free build is preferred.

This would be a separate module or compile-time feature flag, not a replacement for the existing pure-Mojo code.
