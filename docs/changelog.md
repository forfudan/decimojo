# DeciMojo changelog

This is a list of RELEASED changes for the DeciMojo Package.

## 01/07/2025 (v0.4.1)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

Now DeciMojo supports implicit type conversion between built-in integeral types (`Int`, `UInt`, `Int8`, `UInt8`, `Int16`, `UInt16`, `Int32`, `UInt32`, `Int64`, `UInt64`, `Int128`,`UInt128`, `Int256`, and `UInt256`) and the arbitrary-precision integer types (`BigUInt`, `BigInt`, and `BigDecimal`). This allows you to use these built-in types directly in arithmetic operations with `BigInt` and `BigUInt` without explicit conversion. The merged type will always be the most compatible one (PR #89, PR #90).

For example, you can now do the following:

```mojo
from decimojo.prelude import *

fn main() raises:
    var a = BInt(Int256(-1234567890))
    var b = BigUInt(31415926)
    var c = BDec("3.14159265358979323")

    print("a =", a)
    print("b =", b)
    print("c =", c)

    print(a * b)  # Merged to BInt
    print(a + c)  # Merged to BDec
    print(b + c)  # Merged to BDec
    print(a * Int(-128))  # Merged to BInt
    print(b * UInt(8))  # Merged to BUInt
    print(c * Int256(987654321123456789))  # Merged to BDec

    var lst = [a, b, c, UInt8(255), Int64(22222), UInt256(1234567890)]
    # The list is of the type `List[BigDecimal]`
    for i in lst:
        print(i, end=", ")
```

Running the code will give your the following results:

```console
a = -1234567890
b = 31415926
c = 3.14159265358979323
-38785093474216140

```

### ü¶ã Changed

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Fix a bug in `BigDecimal` where it cannot create a correct value from a integral scalar, e.g., `BDec(UInt16(0))` returns an unitialized `BigDecimal` object (PR #89).

### üìö Documentation and testing

- Update the `tests` module and refactor the test files for `BigUInt` (PR #88).

## 25/06/2025 (v0.4.0)

DeciMojo v0.4.0 updates the codebase to Mojo v25.4. This release enables you to use DeciMojo with the latest Mojo features.

## 06/06/2025 (v0.3.1)

DeciMojo v0.3.1 updates the codebase to Mojo v25.3 and replaces the `magic` package manager with `pixi`. This release enables you to use DeciMojo with the latest Mojo features and the new package manager.

## 15/04/2025 (v0.3.0)

DeciMojo v0.3.0 introduces the arbitrary-precision `BigDecimal` type with comprehensive arithmetic operations, comparisons, and mathematical functions (`sqrt`, `root`, `log`, `exp`, `power`). A new `tomlmojo` package supports test refactoring. Improvements include refined `BigUInt` constructors, enhanced `scale_up_by_power_of_10()` functionality, and a critical multiplication bug fix.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Implement the `BigDecimal` type with unlimited precision arithmetic.
  - Implement basic arithmetic operations for `BigDecimal`: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
  - Implement comparison operations for `BigDecimal`: less than, greater than, equal to, and not equal to.
  - Implement string representation and parsing for `BigDecimal`.
  - Implement mathematical operations for `BigDecimal`: `sqrt`, `nroot`, `log`, `exp`, and `power` functions.
  - Iimplement rounding functions.
- Implement a simple TOML parser as package `tomlmojo` to refactor tests (PR #63).

### ü¶ã Changed

- Refine the constructors of `BigUInt` (PR #64).
- Improve the method `BigUInt.scale_up_by_power_of_10()` (PR #72).

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Fix a bug in `BigUInt` multiplication where the calcualtion of carry is mistakenly skipped if a word of x2 is zero (PR #70).

## 01/04/2025 (v0.2.0)

Version 0.2.0 marks a significant expansion of DeciMojo with the introduction of `BigInt` and `BigUInt` types, providing unlimited precision integer arithmetic to complement the existing fixed-precision `Decimal` type. Core arithmetic functions for the `Decimal` type have been completely rewritten using Mojo 25.2's `UInt128`, delivering substantial performance improvements. This release also extends mathematical capabilities with advanced operations including logarithms, exponentials, square roots, and n-th roots for the `Decimal` type. The codebase has been reorganized into a more modular structure, enhancing maintainability and extensibility. With comprehensive test coverage, improved documentation in multiple languages, and optimized memory management, v0.2.0 represents a major advancement in both functionality and performance for numerical computing in Mojo.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Add comprehensive `BigInt` and `BigUInt` implementation with unlimited precision integer arithmetic.
- Implement full arithmetic operations for `BigInt` and `BigUInt`: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo and power operations.
- Support both floor division (round toward negative infinity) and truncate division (round toward zero) semantics for mathematical correctness.
- Add complete comparison operations for `BigInt` with proper handling of negative values.
- Implement efficient string representation and parsing for `BigInt` and `BigUInt`.
- Add advanced mathematical operations for `Decimal`: square root and n-th root.
- Add logarithm functions for `Decimal`: natural logarithm, base-10 logarithm, and logarithm with arbitrary base.
- Add exponential function and power function with arbitrary exponents for `Decimal`.

### ü¶ã Changed

- Completely re-write the core arithmetic functions for `Decimal` type using `UInt128` introduced in Mojo 25.2. This significantly improves the performance of `Decimal` operations.
- Improve memory management system to reduce allocations during calculations.
- Reorganize codebase with modular structure (decimal, arithmetics, comparison, exponential).
- Enhance `Decimal` comparison operators for better handling of edge cases.
- Update internal representation of `Decimal` for better precision handling.

### ‚ùå Removed

- Remove deprecated legacy string formatting methods.
- Remove redundant conversion functions that were replaced with a more unified API.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Fix edge cases in division operations with zero and one.
- Correct sign handling in mixed-sign operations for both `Decimal`.
- Fix precision loss in repeated addition/subtraction operations.
- Correct rounding behavior in edge cases for financial calculations.
- Address inconsistencies between operator methods and named functions.

### üìö Documentation and testing

- Add comprehensive test suite for `BigInt` and `BigUInt` with over 200 test cases covering all operations and edge cases.
- Create detailed API documentation for both `Decimal` and `BigInt`.
- Add performance comparison benchmarks between DeciMojo and Python's decimal/int implementation.
- Update multi-language documentation to include all new functionality (English and Chinese).
- Include clear explanations of division semantics and other potentially confusing numerical concepts.
