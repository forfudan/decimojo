# Decimo changelog

This is a list of changes for the Decimo package (formerly DeciMojo).

## 20260303 (v0.8.0)

> **Library renamed from `decimojo` to `decimo`.** The package name, import path, and all public references have been updated. GitHub repository will be renamed to `forfudan/decimo` (GitHub auto-redirects the old URL).

Decimo v0.8.0 is a profound milestone in the development of Decimo, marking the **"make it fast"** phase. There are two major improvements in this release:

First, it introduces a completely new `BigInt` (`BInt`) type using a **base-2^32 internal representation**. This replaces the previous base-10^9 implementation (now available as `BigInt10`) with a little-endian format using `UInt32` words, dramatically improving the performance of all integer operations. The new `BigInt` implements the **Karatsuba multiplication algorithm** and the **Burnikel-Ziegler division algorithm** for sub-quadratic performance on large integers, and includes **divide-and-conquer base conversion** for fast string I/O. It also adds **bitwise operations**, **GCD and modular arithmetic**, and an optimized **integer square root**. Benchmarks show that the new `BigInt` outperforms Python's built-in `int` type in most cases, with up to 11× speedup for power operations and 5× for shift operations.

Second, it optimizes the mathematical operations for `BigDecimal`, bringing significant performance and accuracy improvements. The `sqrt()` function is re-implemented using the **reciprocal square root method** combined with Newton's method for faster convergence. The `ln()` function now supports an **atanh-based approach** with mathematical constant caching via `MathCache`. The `exp()` function benefits from **aggressive range reduction** for much faster convergence. The `root()` function gains **rational root decomposition** and a direct Newton method. The `to_string()` method is aligned with CPython's `decimal` module formatting rules for scientific notation and trailing zeros. The `BigUInt` layer also gains the **Toom-Cook 3-way multiplication algorithm**. Benchmarks indicate that `BigDecimal` operations beat Python's `decimal` module in speed, especially for high-precision calculations (e.g., division up to 915× faster, sqrt 3.5× faster on average).

### ⭐️ New in v0.8.0

**BigInt (base-2^32):**

1. Implement the `BigInt` (`BInt`) type using a base-2^32 internal representation with little-endian `UInt32` words. This is a completely new implementation optimized for binary computations while supporting arbitrary precision (PR #133, #134, #135, #141).

1. Improve naming consistency between types, ensuring uniform method names across `BigInt`, `BigDecimal`, and `Decimal128` (PR #164).
1. Make `RoundingMode` type implicitly copyable for easier usage in function signatures (PR #125).

### 🛠️ Fixed in v0.8.0

- Fix string formatting for `BigDecimal` to match Python's `decimal` module formatting rules, including correct scientific notation thresholds and trailing zero handling (PR #163, #165).

### 📚 Documentation and testing in v0.8.0

- Refactor the testing files for `Decimal128` (PR #132).
- Refactor the benchmarking system to use TOML-based input files with configurable precision (PR #139, #159).
- Update document links for the repository organization move to `forfudan` (PR #130).
- Update documents and add the planning files for BigInt and BigDecimal optimization roadmaps (PR #157).

## 20260212 (v0.7.0)

DeciMojo v0.7.0 updates the codebase to Mojo v0.26.1.

- Replaces all `alias` declarations with `comptime` in all files. `alias` is deprecated.
- Updates list and constant construction syntax throughout the codebase, e.g., replaced `List[UInt32](...)` with `[UInt32(...), ...]`, used `[word]` instead of `List[UInt32](word)`, etc. The old syntax is deprecated.
- Updates list slicing syntax to use the new syntax. Now `lst[1:]` returns a `Span` instead of a `List`, so it needs to be converted to a list using the constructor `List(...)`.
- Updates some methods of the `String` type and the indexing and slicing syntax for `String` objects to match the latest Mojo syntax. The old syntax is deprecated.
- Fixes the closure capture when using `vectorize`. The new syntax requires something like `unified {read x, mut y}` to capture variables `x` and `y` in the closure. The old syntax is deprecated.

## 20251216 (v0.6.0)

DeciMojo v0.6.0 updates the codebase to Mojo v0.25.7, adopting the new `TestSuite` type for improved test organization. All tests have been refactored to use the native Mojo testing framework instead of the deprecated `pixi test` command.

## 20250806 (v0.5.0)

DeciMojo v0.5.0 introduces significant enhancements to the `BigDecimal` and `BigUInt` types, including new mathematical functions and performance optimizations. The release adds **trigonometric functions** for `BigDecimal`, implements the **Chudnovsky algorithm** for computing π, and implements the **Karatsuba multiplication algorithm** and **Burnikel-Ziegler division algorithm** for `BigUInt`. In-place operations, slice operations, and SIMD operations are now supported for `BigUInt` arithmetic. The `Decimal` type is renamed to `Decimal128` to reflect its 128-bit fixed precision. The release also includes improved error handling, optimized type conversions, refactored testing suites, and documentation updates.

DeciMojo v0.5.0 is compatible with Mojo v25.5.

### ⭐️ New in v0.5.0

1. Introduce trigonometric functions for `BigDecimal`: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `cot()`, `csc()`, `sec()`. These functions compute the corresponding trigonometric values of a given angle in radians with arbitrary precision (#96, #99).
1. Introduce the function `pi()` for `BigDecimal` to compute the value of π (pi) with arbitrary precision with the Chudnovsky algorithm with binary splitting (#95).
1. Implement the `sqrt()` function for `BigUInt` to compute the square root of a `BigUInt` number as a `BigUInt` object (#107).
1. Introduce a `DeciMojoError` type and various aliases to handle errors in DeciMojo. This enables a more consistent error handling mechanism across the library and allows users to track errors more easily (#114).

### 🦋 Changed in v0.5.0

Changes in **BigUInt**:

1. Refine the `BigUInt` multiplication with the **Karatsuba algorithm**. The time complexity of multiplication is reduced from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^{ln(3/2)})$ for large integers, which significantly improves performance for big numbers. Doubling the size of the numbers will only increase the time taken by a factor of about 3, instead of 4 as in the previous implementation (#97).
1. Refine the `BigUInt` division with the **Burnikel-Ziegler fast recursive division algorithm**. The time complexity of division is also reduced from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^{ln(3/2)})$ for large integers (#103).
1. Refine the fall-back **schoolbook division** of `BigUInt` to improve performance. The fallback division is used when the divisor is small enough (#98, #100).
1. Implement auxiliary functions for arithmetic operations of `BigUInt` to handle **special cases** more efficiently, e.g., when the second operand is one-word long or is a `UInt32` value (#98, #104, #111).
1. Implement in-place subtraction for `BigUInt`. The `__isub__` method of `BigUInt` will now conduct in-place subtraction. `x -= y` will not lead to memory allocation, but will modify the original `BigUInt` object `x` directly (#98).
1. Use SIMD for `BigUInt` addition and subtraction operations. This allows the addition and subtraction of two `BigUInt` objects to be performed in parallel, significantly improving performance for large numbers (#101, #102).
1. Implement functions for all arithmetic operations on slices of `BigUInt` objects. This allows you to perform arithmetic operations on slices of `BigUInt` objects without having to convert them to `BigUInt` first, leading to less memory allocation and improved performance (#105).
1. Add `to_uint64()` and `to_uint128()` methods to `BigUInt` to for fast type conversion (#91).

Changes in **BigDecimal**:

1. Re-implemente the `sqrt()` function for `BigDecimal` to use the new `BigUInt.sqrt()` method for better performance and accuracy. The new implementation adjusts the scale and coefficient directly, which is more efficient than the previous method. Introduce a new `sqrt_decimal_approach()` function to preserve the old implementation for reference (#108).
1. Refine or re-implement the basic arithmetic operations, *e.g.,*, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc, for `BigDecimal` and simplify the logic. The new implementation is more efficient and easier to understand, leading to better performance (#109, #110).
1. Add a default precision 36 for `BigDecimal` methods (#112).

Other changes:

1. Update the codebase to Mojo v25.5 (#113).
1. Remove unnecessary `raises` keywords for all functions (#92).
1. Rename the `Decimal` type to `Decimal128` to reflect its fixed precision of 128 bits. It has a new alias `Dec128` (#112).
1. `Decimal` is now an alias for `BigDecimal` (#112).

### 🛠️ Fixed in v0.5.0

- Fix a bug for `BigUInt` comparison: When there are leading zero words, the comparison returns incorrect results (#97).
- Fix the `is_zero()`, `is_one()`, and `is_two()` methods for `BigUInt` to correctly handle the case when there are leading zero words (#97).

### 📚 Documentation and testing in v0.5.0

- Refactor the test files for `BigDecimal` (PR #93).
- Refactor the test files for `BigInt` (PR #106).

## 20250701 (v0.4.1)

Version 0.4.1 of DeciMojo introduces implicit type conversion between built-in integral types and arbitrary-precision types.

### ⭐️ New in v0.4.1

Now DeciMojo supports implicit type conversion between built-in integeral types (`Int`, `UInt`, `Int8`, `UInt8`, `Int16`, `UInt16`, `Int32`, `UInt32`, `Int64`, `UInt64`, `Int128`,`UInt128`, `Int256`, and `UInt256`) and the arbitrary-precision types (`BigUInt`, `BigInt`, and `BigDecimal`). This allows you to use these built-in types directly in arithmetic operations with `BigInt` and `BigUInt` without explicit conversion. The merged type will always be the most compatible one (PR #89, PR #90).

For example, you can now do the following:

```mojo
from decimojo.prelude import *

fn main() raises:
    var a = BInt(Int256(-1234567890))
    var b = BigUInt(31415926)
    var c = BDec("3.14159265358979323")

    print("a =", a)
    print("b =", b)
    print("c =", c)

    print(a * b)  # Merged to BInt
    print(a + c)  # Merged to BDec
    print(b + c)  # Merged to BDec
    print(a * Int(-128))  # Merged to BInt
    print(b * UInt(8))  # Merged to BUInt
    print(c * Int256(987654321123456789))  # Merged to BDec

    var lst = [a, b, c, UInt8(255), Int64(22222), UInt256(1234567890)]
    # The list is of the type `List[BigDecimal]`
    for i in lst:
        print(i, end=", ")
```

Running the code will give your the following results:

```console
a = -1234567890
b = 31415926
c = 3.14159265358979323
-38785093474216140
-1234567886.85840734641020677
31415929.14159265358979323
158024689920
251327408
3102807559527666386.46423202534973847
-1234567890, 31415926, 3.14159265358979323, 255, 22222, 1234567890,
```

### 🦋 Changed in v0.4.1

Optimize the case when you increase the value of a `BigInt` object in-place by 1, *i.e.*, `i += 1`. This allows you to iterate faster (PR #89). For example, we can compute the time taken to iterate from `0` to `1_000_000` using `BigInt` and compare it with the built-in `Int` type:

```mojo
from decimojo.prelude import *

fn main() raises:
    i = BigInt(0)
    end = BigInt(1_000_000)
    while i < end:
        print(i)
        i += 1
```

| scenario        | Time taken |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| v0.4.0 `BigInt` | 1.102s     |
| v0.4.1 `BigInt` | 0.912s     |
| Built-in `Int`  | 0.893s     |

### 🛠️ Fixed in v0.4.1

Fix a bug in `BigDecimal` where it cannot create a correct value from a integral scalar, e.g., `BDec(UInt16(0))` returns an unitialized `BigDecimal` object (PR #89).

### 📚 Documentation and testing in v0.4.1
